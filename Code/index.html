            For those of us who have kept chickens for any length of time, we like to think we 
            know one or two things about them.Like what time they rise for breakfast all the way
            through to their favourite things to eat (for ours it’s worms)!However, we’d bet that
            below we have compiled 20 surprising things even the most seasoned chicken-keeper 
            wouldn’t know before reading this…

            It’s widely believed that chickens are colour blind and have poor vision- this is not
            the case. They actually have better vision than humans Humans have three different cone
            types in their eyes which mean we can perceive red, green and blue colours. Whereas chickens 
            have an additional two cone types which allows them to also distinguish violet and ultraviolet ligh
 
            This means roosters can see the sunrise and crow well before humans can even see the 
            sunrise- often this is around an hour before humans can see the sunrise
            Chickens have over 30 unique noises they can produce- all of which are used for different
            purposes. Their clucks and crows are mostly used to raise an alarm, normally either 
            for danger or food!

            We say over 30 unique noises but in reality it’s probably much higher than this, however 
            so far scientists have only tracked 30.Roosters, for example, have different vocalizations 
            that alert their hens to newly discovered food items. He will cluck to them to tell them to
             stop by and have a snack, and as always, ladies first.A rooster’s crow alarms hens of
            impending danger, but it can also be a way of communicating with their caretakers when they
            need something.Roosters will also show his hens where he believes are the perfect nesting 
            areas. He will snuggle into a small space and cluck lightly to his hens to showcase how, 
            and where, they should nest.
